# Pladoo-SQL-String
Pladoo SQL String was created with a simple objective, convert my SQL notes structure into a SQL Server understandable code.
It's simple to use, and has a very easy syntax. 

TableName::Field1[fieldtype|opt param|opt param],Field2[fieldtype(fieldsize)],Field3[fieldtype]

Real case example: 
Users::id[int|NOT NULL|Primary Key],name[varchar(255)],birthdate[datetime]

To use the script "sqlnote.php", you just need to run the page on a local or online server, and type/paste the string on the text field, 
and click "Generate SQL" button
